# RPG-Iteration-2
Hopefully this iteration will be amazing.

Make sure to update your project structure to be able to talk to the resources (res) folder. You will get a ton of errors if you don't do this This can be done be going to:
File --> Project Structure --> Libraries --> Click green plus button --> select "res" folder --> select classes option.

If building from source, file paths need to be changed (we really need to fix this in the future). The root folder it looks in is /src. Which means if you have something that looks in /res/whatever, it needs to be changed to ../res/whatever. Keep in mind

Navigation done with the numpad 789-123 or QWE-ASD.

Backspace will always either exit or go back in a menu.

'Z' will mount/unmount a vehicle (turtle).

'X' will open status view.

'C' will attack.

'V' will open your skills to use.

Enter will get you through the first two screens.

Controls can now be reconfigured by pressing ESC in-game.

Don't use the SHIFT key ever...for whatever reasons, it produces problems.
